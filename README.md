# ShaderCreationHelper
A minecraft mod setup to easily test and create shaders on the fly

This mod provides two test entities that use shaders for their render. 
To try shaders, create a "shaders" folder in your run directory and put your shaders in it. 
Then use the "/load <file>" command to select a fragment shader and a vertex shader.
Finally, right click with the test item to load/reload shaders in game.

This mod is not intended to be used by the general public, though if anyone wants to use it they can.
Keep in mind that there's little chance that I consider issues reported in this repository.
